This app uses the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with Will Ferrel feeling gifs.  
It calls the Giphy API and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the website.
(When the user clicks on one of the Giphy images, the gif animates.  If the user clicks the gif again, 
it stops playing.)
